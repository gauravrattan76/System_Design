proxy vs reverse proxy vs load balancer vs cdn
______


are super common in web architecture, and they all deal with routing traffic, but in different directions and purposes.


1. Proxy (aka Forward Proxy)
➡️ Direction: Client → Proxy → Internet
* The client connects to a proxy server, which then requests resources on behalf of the client.
🧠 Used for:
* Hiding client identity (IP)
* Controlling and filtering client access
* Corporate firewalls or parental controls
💡 Think of:
A user using a VPN or proxy to access a website

User → Proxy → Google.com



2. Reverse Proxy
➡️ Direction: Internet → Reverse Proxy → Server
* The client thinks it's talking to a server, but it's actually talking to a reverse proxy which forwards the request to the real backend.
‘
Used for:
* Hiding backend servers
* SSL termination
* Load balancing
* Caching
* API gateway

3. Load Balancer
➡️ Direction: Client → Load Balancer → Multiple Servers
* Distributes traffic across multiple backend servers to balance load, improve speed, and increase redundancy.



Used for:
* High availability (HA)
* Scalability
* Preventing overload on any one server



AWS ELB, HAProxy, or NGINX sending requests to several app servers

Client -->|--> App Server 2
          +--> App Server 3
Sometimes, a reverse proxy is also a load balancer, like NGINX.


4.4. CDN (Content Delivery Network)
➡️ Direction: User → Nearest CDN Edge → Cached Content / Origin
* A global network of edge servers that cache and serve static content close to users.


Used for:
* Speed (faster load times by proximity)
* Reducing origin server load
* Serving static files (JS, CSS, images)
* DDoS protection
