Vertical scaling -


Optimise performance and increase throughput with the same resource , itâ€™s called vertical scaling.


Certainly! Let's delve into the concepts of data preprocessing and cron jobs, both of which are fundamental in their respective domains.

ðŸ§¹ What is Data Preprocessing?
Data preprocessing is a crucial step in data science and machine learning that involves transforming raw data into a clean and usable format. This process ensures that the data is accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis or modeling.
Key Steps in Data Preprocessing:
1. Handling Missing Values: Identifying and addressing gaps in the data, either by removing incomplete records or imputing missing values using statistical methods like mean, median, or mode.Simplilearn.com
2. Encoding Categorical Data: Converting non-numeric categories into numerical formats using techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding, enabling algorithms to process them effectively.
3. Feature Scaling: Standardizing or normalizing data to ensure that numerical features have a similar scale, which is essential for many machine learning algorithms.
4. Splitting the Dataset: Dividing the data into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate the performance of models and prevent overfitting.Simplilearn.com
5. Data Transformation: Applying mathematical transformations to features to enhance model performance, such as logarithmic scaling or polynomial features.
Effective data preprocessing improves model accuracy, reduces training time, and enhances the interpretability of results.

ðŸ•’ What is a Cron Job?
A cron job is a scheduled task in Unix-like operating systems that runs automatically at specified intervals. It's managed by the cron daemon, which executes commands or scripts at predetermined times, dates, or intervals.
Common Applications of Cron Jobs:
* Automated Backups: Scheduling regular backups of databases or files to ensure data integrity.Cronjob Manager
* System Maintenance: Running scripts for tasks like cleaning up temporary files or updating software packages.
* Data Synchronization: Automating the transfer of data between systems or services at set intervals.
* Email Notifications: Sending out scheduled reports or alerts to users.Seobility
* Website Monitoring: Checking the status of websites or services to ensure they are operational.
Cron jobs are defined in a configuration file called crontab, where users specify the timing and the command to execute. Wikipedia


Have pre processing - like a cron job


Avoid single point of failure - master slave



Higher more resources - horizontal scaling, burn machine of similar types to get work done


Microservice architecture.
