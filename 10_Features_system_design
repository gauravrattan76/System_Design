Key concepts in system design-
__________________________________________



1. Sacalbility- a system is called scalable when it doesn’t need to be redesigned to maintain affective performance as the increase in load / traffic



____________________________-



2. Reliability- a system is described as reliable even if keeps delivering its services even when several of it software/hardware components fail

A system if reliable if request for the data return the same data

Availablity-


The uptime of a website is critical.


Availability is a typically given as a percentage of time a system is expected to to be avialable (99.999) percent

Latency / efficency-


Latency - time required to transmit a message from one location to another location with in distributed system


Latency: The time it takes for a single operation or request to complete. This includes the time from when a request is initiated to when the response is received. It's typically measured in milliseconds (ms) or microseconds (µs) .
Throughput: The number of operations or requests a system can handle in a given time frame, often measured in requests per second (RPS) or transactions per second (TPS) .


Bandwidth/ throughput-

The amount of data that can be transferred per uint of time in a stable system
